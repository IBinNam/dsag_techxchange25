# SAPUI5 Accessibility Example

## Overview

This SAPUI5 application demonstrates how to create accessible user interfaces by incorporating ARIA attributes and meaningful text alternatives for non-text content.

## Features

- **Accessible Images**: Images include `alt` attributes and ARIA properties like `aria-labelledby` to ensure screen readers can convey equivalent information.
- **Text Descriptions**: Text elements provide additional context for non-text content, improving the user experience for visually impaired users.

## Accessibility Details

- The `Image` control uses the `aria-labelledby` property to associate it with a `Text` element that provides a detailed description.
- The `alt` attribute ensures that screen readers can describe the image content.

## Testing Accessibility

- Use tools like ChromeVox or NVDA to verify that the image description is read aloud by the screen reader.
- Ensure that the `alt` text and ARIA attributes are correctly interpreted.
