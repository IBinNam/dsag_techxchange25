# Lesson 3 - Level Example

This lesson focuses on demonstrating the importance of semantic HTML in SAP UI5 applications to enhance accessibility. It highlights how using proper heading elements (`<Title>` with levels like `H1`, `H2`, etc.) improves both the visual hierarchy and the experience for assistive technologies like screen readers.

## Features

- Accessible headings using `<Title>` elements with appropriate levels (`H1`, `H2`, etc.).
- Illustrates the role of semantic HTML in creating inclusive web applications.
- Built using SAP UI5 with the `sap.m` library.

## Accessibility

This example emphasizes the critical role of semantic HTML elements, such as `<Title>`, in ensuring that assistive technologies can accurately interpret the page structure. Proper use of headings improves navigation for users relying on screen readers and other accessibility tools.
