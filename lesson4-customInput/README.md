# Lesson 4 - Custom Input

This lesson demonstrates how to create a custom SAP UI5 control for an input field with `autocomplete="off"`. The custom control ensures that browsers and assistive technologies do not offer autocomplete suggestions, improving accessibility for users with cognitive disabilities.

The `CustomInput` control disables autocomplete to:
- Prevent browsers from offering autocomplete suggestions.
- Avoid pre-filling fields with known user data.
- Support users with cognitive disabilities who benefit from manual input.
